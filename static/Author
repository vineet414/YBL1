### âœ… Next Steps:
1. **Create a new GitHub repo** named `ai-art-generator`.
2. Upload these files in the correct folder structure.
3. Replace `"your_api_key_here"` with a valid API key.
4. Commit and push the code.

Would you like me to prepare a `.zip` file for easy upload or help you publish it on GitHub directly (if you provide GitHub username & repo name)?
